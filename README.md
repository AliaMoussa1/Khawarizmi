# Khawarizmi

Khawarizmi is a desktop software testing and comparing different sorting algorithms efficiency and graphing the number of steps taken by each to sort the same number of elements.
Khawarizmi is named after the great mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, or al-Khwarizmi and formerly Latinized as Algorithmi, whom the word "Algorithm" was derived from.
I designed the logo in the startup window using Canva, but I don't own the drawing of Al Khawarizmi.
